# Dioxus: iOS

This example showcases Dioxus support for mobile. Currently, only iOS is supported. To get started, follow the cargo-mobile getting started guide and then use the `cargo apple` commands to build and test for iOS.

To run, `cargo apple run` works. To open XCode and select a device, try `cargo apple open`.
